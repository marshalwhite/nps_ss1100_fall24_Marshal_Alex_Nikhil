# SS1100: Intro to Programming for Space Applications
## Final Project: Programming Spacecraft Systems

### Assignment
- **Instructions**: Work in groups of four to complete the steps outlined in the project instructions.
- **Submission**: All of your submission will go here in this repository, to include this README file to hold your writeup.

### Procedure
#### Preparation
- Employ programming skills to solve problems related to spacecraft subsystems.
- Develop code and responses to tasks in various sections.
- Experience working with code and collaborating on a coding project.

#### Requirements
1. Complete all tasks listed in each section, paying attention to the Evaluation subsections.
2. Use MatLab to complete at least one of the tasks.
3. Submit the project using GitHub, replacing the content of this README file with your writeup and presentation of the work.

#### Subsystems and Tasks
Reaction Control Subsystem (RCS): Malfunction detection and velocity change calculation.\
Thermal Control Subsystem (TCS): Temperature control function.\
Attitude Control Subsystem (ACS): Attitude determination and rotation calculations.\
Command and Data Handling (C&DH): Command parsing and routing.\
Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS): Power budget analysis and battery charging calculations.\
Remote Sensing Payload: Data ingestion, radiance to reflectance conversion, and image rescaling.

#### Questions
1. What was your experience in collaborating? Talk about what steps you used to ensure the
inputs from group members worked - code testing, GitHub branch management, etc. - and
how you divided up the workload for the project.

Our group divided the project into three separate sections giving each team member two total sections each to code. We completed our sections without much collaboration aside from occasional troubleshooting conducted in person in between classes. Once we had each compiled our own code, we uploaded our segments to a Test Branch created on our Github. We had at least one other person make sure that the code would run correctly before pushing our code to the Main Branch.

2. What was the most challenging section, and why? Feel free to provide more than one response
if there is a difference of opinion in the group.


3. If you employed Generative AI tools, how did you do so? Discuss which tools you used, the
prompts you utilized, how you ensured the results were valid, and how you integrated the code
into your tasks.


4. What other resources did you use to find solutions? Online sites, books, references, etc.



5. In what way could this project be improved for future quarters?
